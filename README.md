Laravel Backend API Project

This is a Laravel 11 application, serving as a dedicated backend API. It manages core application data, including invoices and customer information, connecting to a MySQL database.

**Installation Guide**

To get the API running on your local machine, follow these steps.

Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

PHP (>= 8.2 recommended): Laravel 11 requires PHP 8.2 or higher.

Composer: For managing PHP dependencies.

MySQL: Your database server.

Node.js & npm (Optional): Only necessary if you plan to use Laravel's internal asset compilation (Vite) for any potential future views or dashboards.

Installation Instructions

Clone the Repository

If this project is in a repository, clone it to your local machine:

git clone [your-repository-url]
cd [project-name]


Install PHP Dependencies

Use Composer to download all the necessary PHP packages:

composer install


Set Up Environment File

Copy the example environment file and create your local configuration:

cp .env.example .env


Configure .env

Open the newly created .env file and update the following sections. Note that the default template might show SQLite settings; be sure to change these to your MySQL credentials:

Set the application name and URL:

APP_NAME="Laravel API"
APP_URL=http://localhost:8000


Configure MySQL database connection:

DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=your_database_name
DB_USERNAME=your_db_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password


Generate Application Key

This command sets the necessary encryption key for your application:

php artisan key:generate


Run Database Migrations and Seeding

Set up the database tables and populate them with initial data (including the invoices table):

php artisan migrate --seed


Start the Local Server

Launch the Laravel development server:

php artisan serve


The API should now be running at http://127.0.0.1:8000.

Usage and Testing

Accessing the API

All API routes are prefixed with /api (routes are defined in routes/api.php). For example, if you have a route defined as /invoices, the full URL is:

http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/invoices

Use a tool like Postman or Insomnia to send GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests to your endpoints.
